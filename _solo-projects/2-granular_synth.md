{% contentfor project-description %}

The Granular Synth was created over the course of 8 Weeks as a project to gain familiarity with JUCE and granular synthesis. 

Over the course of this project, I practiced writing code that was extremely well documented and using GitHub to publicly open source the project. 

Additionally, I became comfortable with how DSP works inside JUCE, and learned a significant amount about Granular Synthesis both through the experience of writing the synthesizer and using Microsound by Curis Roads as a fantastic reference
