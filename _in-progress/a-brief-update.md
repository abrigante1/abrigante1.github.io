## Where I've Been

Hey all!

It's been a while since I've made my last post...sorry about that! Shortly after I started this blog series, I began my summer internship at Qualcomm on the Audio R&D team. I originally intended on continuing my work on Boundless throughout the internship, but I ended up being quite busy during the days and wanted to spend my evenings with my family. I was planning on making a post about my short break earlier but ADHD has it's ways and that post slipped through the cracks. 

However, as my internship begins to come to a close and my final year at DigiPen is starting to begin, I'll have a bit more time here and there to work on Boundless once again! I'm not quite sure how frequently I'll be posting, but it should at *least* be monthly. 

Over the last few days I've been considering where I'd like to take this project and have decided it would be best to pivot quite a bit. Boundless was originally intended to be a shorter project to get me used to Rust and have me making more games, but as I reconsider things, I'd like to turn Rust into a proper personal project that I work on over an extended period of time without too much of a goal in mind. A project in which I can use to learn new technologies, and create a project I can be really proud of. 

## The Pivot. 

tl;dr: I'm going to rebuild Boundless from scratch. 

I don't have too much implemented at the moment, and I think the architectural decisions I made will either have been a great learning experience or heavily referenced during the reconstruction. A core reasoning behind this rebuild is a desire to switch to [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), a cute new Rust game framework that was built with egonomics and simplicity in mind. I also see Bevy as an opportunity to start getting myself more involved with the open source game development community. With Bevy being a new framework, I'm certain there will be points where I can help along the way :)

Furthermore, alongside this switch, I've decided I'm going to move the game into **THE THIRD DIMENSION**. Yeah, that's right. We making this bad boy 3D! The primary reasoning behind this is because I believe it more directly suits my original vision for the title. I really want Boundless to become my own twist on the sandbox genre, combining all the things I love from games like Terraria and Minecraft. I feel that within a 3D space, I allow myself more opportunity to play around with really novel and interesting ideas that I have bouncing around in my head. 

## Moving Forward

So where next? The same place we began last time -- with getting things drawing on the screen! I'm also planning on trying to break things down into smaller pieces with the hope of it helping me publish more frequently, so moving forward expect more bite-sized update posts, rather then entire system implementations :) 

See you then!
