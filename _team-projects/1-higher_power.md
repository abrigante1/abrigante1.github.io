{% contentfor project-description %}

Higher Power is a VR God Game build in the Unreal Engine 4, in which you play as a Druid defending Nature from the invasion of Machines. 

This was a team project built with six other members. 

For this project, I was the Technical Director, and Generalist Programmer (focusing on Gameplay and Audio). 

As technical director, I was responsible for enforcing our programming style guide as well as developing any technical work pipelines such as our Perforce Workflow. 

As a Generalist Programmer I worked on two core systems -- A [Custom HRTF Wwise Plugin](./HRTF.html) and a Temperature System. 

The Temperature System is an emergent gameplay system that allows for object to radiate heat / cold to other nearby objects.

For example, a player could light an enemy on fire, and then toss the enemy into a swarm of additional enemies and begin to light them on fire as well.
