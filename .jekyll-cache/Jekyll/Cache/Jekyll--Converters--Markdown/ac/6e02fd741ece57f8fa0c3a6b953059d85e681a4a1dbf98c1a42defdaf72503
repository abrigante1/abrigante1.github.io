<p>The Granular Synth was created over the course of 8 Weeks as a project to gain familiarity with JUCE and granular synthesis.</p>

<p>Over the course of this project, I practiced writing code that was extremely well documented and using GitHub to publicly open source the project.</p>

<p>Additionally, I became comfortable with how DSP works inside JUCE, and learned a significant amount about Granular Synthesis both through the experience of writing the synthesizer and using Microsound by Curis Roads as a fantastic reference</p>
