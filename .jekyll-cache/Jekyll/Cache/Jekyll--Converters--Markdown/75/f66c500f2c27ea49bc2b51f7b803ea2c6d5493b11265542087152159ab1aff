<p>Higher Power is a VR God Game build in the Unreal Engine 4, in which you play as a Druid defending Nature from the invasion of Machines.</p>

<p>This was a team project built with six other members.</p>

<p>For this project, I was the Technical Director, and Generalist Programmer (focusing on Gameplay and Audio).</p>

<p>As technical director, I was responsible for enforcing our programming style guide as well as developing any technical work pipelines such as our Perforce Workflow.</p>

<p>As a Generalist Programmer I worked on two core systems â€“ A <a href="./HRTF.html">Custom HRTF Wwise Plugin</a> and a Temperature System.</p>

<p>The Temperature System is an emergent gameplay system that allows for object to radiate heat / cold to other nearby objects.</p>

<p>For example, a player could light an enemy on fire, and then toss the enemy into a swarm of additional enemies and begin to light them on fire as well.</p>
